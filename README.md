# Landing Page Project:
## Udacity Project (Professional Track)
 
### Introduction:

 The starter project with HTML and CSS code to display a static version of the Landing Page Project which is taken from udacity. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to dynamic one. The dynamicity is achieved by built JavaScript file.

### About:

 There are 4 sections that have been added to the page. Active sections in view are highlighted when scrolling. Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link will scroll to the appropriate section. The navigation bar is hidden when scrolling and reappears when the user stops scrolling. All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

### Languages:

 HTML5, CSS3, and javascript.
